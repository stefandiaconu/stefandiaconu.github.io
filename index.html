	<h1>Personal Statement</h1>
	<p>For me computer science means evolution which is one of the most important thing in human history.
		Everywhere around the world computers help people in almost all domains (if not all) like medicine,
		sport, art, business and many more. Researches are taken place every day to improve communication between people,
		departments in a company, cities and even countries, to understand better history, geography, the nature
		and not the last, a lot of researches are made in medicine to discover better treatments for different maladies.</p>
	<p>It is fascinating to know how things are build up, what stays behind the closed curtains, to discover and
		understand the process step by step. You start to learn in a specific area which involves computers and after
		you find out that all of them are connected somehow. Studying computer science will cover all the domains where
		computers are used and will help me to develop and improve my skills in this domain.</p>
	<p>Computers and programming interested me from an early age, my first encounter was with a neighbor who
		showed me a program based software install, from then on my passion growth.</p>
	<p>In high school and personal time at home, I would repair neighborâ€™s computers installing software new
		components and hardware followed by physical cleans of fans and drivers helping me gain more experience.</p>
	<p>Studying three years of computer science in my country but being unable to finish due to moving to London,
		I wish to further my knowledge by returning to studies.</p>
	<p>Since then all of my choices in further education are about real profiles: mathematics, informatics, physics and chemistry.</p>
	<p>After finishing high school, started to work in hotels this helped me to develop my communication skills with guests.
		How to organize yourself while working under pressure with last minute changes in schedules while maintaining good
		discipline and manners working directly with the guests. Teamwork and leasing with other departments was a major part of my job.</p>
	<p>From then I changed industry and started to work at sports bets, here I had the opportunity to grow and become a shift leader,
		giving me more responsibilities opening and closing the branch, create reports for the daily cash up.</p>
	<p>Following this I move to London, to improve my English and discover a new world, by starting to work in the meeting and events.
		Here I really understood how you go from an empty ballroom to a full live event for hundreds of guests, while keeping a
		high standard and to be focused all the time.</p>
	<p>Having 10 years of work experience, I learned how to work with people, to work in a team with colleagues
		and others departments within the industry.</p>
	<p>Helping me to understand and anticipate daily basics tasks and last minute changes in schedules.</p>
	<p>Hobbies are sport, follow all major events like World Cup, Olympics or big tennis tournaments.</p>
	<p>Interests like music, traveling and cuisine, exploring and discover new places, new cultures, set new
		goals and make new achievements.</p>
	<p>Studying this course will open a very large field of opportunities and I'm looking forward to follow a
		master degree after completing it. Thinking positive and having a big motivation in achieving more
		knowledges will help me with my future plans, making a good career in computers industry.</p>
