		<h1>Computer Science</h1>
		<p>The focus of this degree is on the theoretical foundations of computing.
		The course encourages a general and abstract understanding of the underlying principles
		of computing with an emphasis on data structures, algorithms, networks and operating systems.
		You will cover the fundamental areas of computing such as programming, multimedia, computer architecture,
		information systems and databases, as well as more specialised areas such as forensic computing,
		artificial intelligence, computer mathematics and software engineering. In your final year,
		you will study cutting-edge topics with guidance from research leaders and undertake a large-scale project</p>

			<p>In Year 1 you will study a core set of skills including programming, web design and development,
			information systems and databases, computer hardware and computing logic and mathematics.
			You will learn a particular style of programming so that you can learn similar languages without
			further formal teaching. This degree course is part of a network of degrees including Computer Science,
			Software Engineering and Computing, which all share a common first year, allowing you to transfer
			between them after Year 1 should you wish to.</p>
