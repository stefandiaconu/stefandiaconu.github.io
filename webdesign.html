	<h1>Computer Science</h1>
		<p>The focus of this degree is on the theoretical foundations of computing.
		The course encourages a general and abstract understanding of the underlying principles
		of computing with an emphasis on data structures, algorithms, networks and operating systems.
		You will cover the fundamental areas of computing such as programming, multimedia, computer architecture,
		information systems and databases, as well as more specialised areas such as forensic computing,
		artificial intelligence, computer mathematics and software engineering. In your final year,
		you will study cutting-edge topics with guidance from research leaders and undertake a large-scale project</p>
		<h2>Year 1</h2>
		<p>In Year 1 you will study a core set of skills including programming, web design and development,
		information systems and databases, computer hardware and computing logic and mathematics.
		You will learn a particular style of programming so that you can learn similar languages without
		further formal teaching. This degree course is part of a network of degrees including Computer Science,
		Software Engineering and Computing, which all share a common first year, allowing you to transfer
		between them after Year 1 should you wish to.</p>

		<h3>Introduction to Web Design and Development</h3>
		<p>Introduces the modern context of web design and development, the core development technologies and standards
		and design methods that cater for different current platforms. The key theme of the unit is the efficient
		design and development of effective and robust websites for the range of popular platforms using the most
		modern technologies and techniques.
		<ul>
			Topics include:
			<li>Introduction to the client-server model, web standards, HTML5 semantic mark up, control of presentation via style sheets,
				interactivity via JavaScript on the client side and PHP on the server side</li>
			<li>The use of high-level tools for design and development</li>
			<li>DOM element selection and manipulation via script libraries such as jQuery</li>
			<li>The production of standards compliant HTML5 video. Students will create dynamic web pages with</li>
			<li>AMP systems and script on the server side using PHP with MySQL and perform a basic install of a
			Content Management System such as WordPress. The key theme for scripting will be the understanding
			and development of readable code that listens for and responds to browser and user events by manipulating DOM elements.</li>
