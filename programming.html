	<h1>Computer Science</h1>
		<p>The focus of this degree is on the theoretical foundations of computing.
		The course encourages a general and abstract understanding of the underlying principles
		of computing with an emphasis on data structures, algorithms, networks and operating systems.
		You will cover the fundamental areas of computing such as programming, multimedia, computer architecture,
		information systems and databases, as well as more specialised areas such as forensic computing,
		artificial intelligence, computer mathematics and software engineering. In your final year,
		you will study cutting-edge topics with guidance from research leaders and undertake a large-scale project</p>
		<h2>Year 1</h2>
		<p>In Year 1 you will study a core set of skills including programming, web design and development,
		information systems and databases, computer hardware and computing logic and mathematics.
		You will learn a particular style of programming so that you can learn similar languages without
		further formal teaching. This degree course is part of a network of degrees including Computer Science,
		Software Engineering and Computing, which all share a common first year, allowing you to transfer
		between them after Year 1 should you wish to.</p>

		<h3>Programming (Java)</h3>
		<p>This unit introduces computer programming in a high level programming language and includes principles
		and practice in problem solving, program design, solution implementation and testing, including:
		<ul>
			<li>Introduction to programming using Java</li>
			<li>Software life cycle: importance of correctly identifying the problem, iterative nature of software development, software maintenance</li>
			<li>Design methodology: the application of the top-down design method using step-wise refinement to produce pseudo-code solutions to problems,
				incorporating constructs for sequence selection, iteration, abstraction and re-use</li>
			<li>Verification and testing: the use of desk-top execution, simple debugging strategies and more formal approaches to testing e.g.
				black box white box boundary analysis and equivalence classes</li>
			<li>Applications of standards and conventions: software maintenance and developing a professional approach to coding</li>
			<li>Constructs and features of a structured high level programming language: control constructs, operators,
				procedural abstraction, simple I/O and use of libraries</li>
			<li>Data types â€“ primitive types: constants, variables, arrays and simple structured data</li>
			<li>Object orientated design and implementation: inheritance and polymorphism</li>
			<li>Software support environment: use of an IDE editors compiler/linkers and operating systems</li>
